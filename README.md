## Abstract

Machine Translation (MT) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools have significantly evolved over the past few decades, leading to notable advancements in language technology. However, most of these developments have focused on high-resource languages such as English, Chinese, and European languages, while African languages remain underrepresented. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities in creating and refining MT and NLP models tailored to African languages. It discusses their unique linguistic features, the current state of tools, and outlines strategies for more inclusive language technology development.
